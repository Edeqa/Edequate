<h2>Admin security</h2>

<p>Every administrator must care about his account security. Here are few points:</p>

<ul>
    <li>strong password</li>
    <p>Password must be at least medium strength. That means length of password no less than 9 characters. Password with length 12 character or more is strong. Usually, it does not matter what kind of symbols do you use, the most important thing is the length. But please do not use long passwords containing predictable symbols like "1111111111" or "abcdefghijk". It is very easy to detect those passwords with brut-force. Using the simple sentence is the better idea.</p>

    <li>emergency e-mail</li>
    <p>Please set the valid emergency e-mail. If you forget your password then the system allows to restore your access to admin dashboard. You click the "Forgot password" button and type your login or e-mail. The system generates one-time access key and sends it to your e-mail. Thus, if the email is not defined then you'll not be able to restore your access.</p>

    <li>expiration date</li>
    <p>You may also set the expiration date of password. It is just the time when your password will no more valid to access to the admin dashboard. This setting is optional.</p>
</ul>

<p>Usually, when your account is not secured then the system will inform you via admin dashboard. Please take some actions to resolve the issue in this case.</p>
